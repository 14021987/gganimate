This is the home of the development version of gganimate. It is destined to 
deviate completely from the prior version and will be a complete rewrite. It
goes without saying that this is a **Work in Progress**.

When I get the time I will outline my thoughts and ideas in this readme so it
can serve as a whitepaper for what I have in mind - I haven't got the time 
now...
